# QBlackScholesEquation
A test project for implementing the Black Scholes Equation binomial tree using qiskit. Updating with better code soon!

 In theory it could help reduce the computational complexity of computing d-dimensional options from O(N^d) to O(d*log N). Uses superposition with N qubits to encode 2^N price paths.
